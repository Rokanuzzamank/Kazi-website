            <h2>Faith, Self-Love & Purpose</h2>
            <small>April 2025</small>
            <p>I love reading and listening to the Quran, and spending time in prayer. These moments ground me and guide my heart. The best teachings from the Quran and the actions of the beloved Prophet (PBUH) encourage us to practice self-love and grow as individuals. It is our duty to care for our soul, our worth, and our purpose — for the sake of Allah (SWT).</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-style: italic;">“Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.”</p>
            <p>This belief keeps me strong and reminds me that Islam is not just a religion, but a way of life filled with compassion, balance, and strength.</p>

            <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
            <small>April 2025</small>
            <p>I was born on April 11, 1999, and since then, life has been a mix of growth, discovery, and dreams. I believe that every moment we live — even the small ones — shapes who we become. This blog is my space to share stories, thoughts, and lessons along the way.</p>

            <h2>Evenings That Make Me Smile</h2>
            <small>March 2025</small>
            <p>In the evenings, I enjoy having some snacks and going out to play with my friends. These simple moments remind me how beautiful life can be. My parents and teachers have taught me to be kind, respectful, and humble. I always try my best to follow their guidance with love and gratitude.</p>

            <h2>Staying Balanced in Life</h2>
            <small>February 2025</small>
            <p>Life isn’t just about goals — it’s also about peace, happiness, and balance. I find mine through walks in nature, a good book, or a quiet evening with my thoughts. Every day is a chance to learn, feel, and grow.</p>
